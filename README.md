# eCommerce App
An eCommerce application made in collaboration with [@marinrika](https://github.com/marinrika) and [@pakhomovivan](https://github.com/pakhomovivan) to test our teamwork skills. In this app users can browse through a vast range of products, view detailed descriptions, add their favorite items to the cart, and proceed to checkout. It also includes features such as user registration and login, product search, product categorization, and sorting to make the shopping experience more streamlined and convenient.  
App powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [React JS](https://react.dev), [Redux](https://redux.js.org) ([RTK](https://redux-toolkit.js.org)) and [CommerceTools](https://commercetools.com/) as API provider.  
Guidance during the project provided by [@Lneer](https://github.com/Lneer) and [@OrangeJazz](https://github.com/OrangeJazz).
